        <h2>Air-Fried Hard-Cooked Eggs</h2>
        <p>I love not having to wait for the water to boil and not having to wash the pot. I just place my eggs in the air fryer and in 15 minutes they're hard-boiled.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 egg whites</li>
            <li>Bowl of cold (or iced) water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an air fryer to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C)</li>
            <li>Place eggs in the air fryer basket.</li>
            <li>Cook eggs for 15 minutes. Remove eggs and place in a cold water bath until fully cooled, 8 to 10 minutes</li>
        </ol>
